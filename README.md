# Description

Code from [Black Hat Python](https://www.nostarch.com/blackhatpython) book in **Python 3**. The book has code in Python 2,
this repo contains the equivalent code but in Python 3.

# Important Notes

* The `scapy` version used only works with Python 2. There is, however, an unofficial Python 3 version ([scapy3k](https://github.com/phaethon/scapy), which works just fine,
from my own experience). To install it with pip, run the following: `pip install scapy-python3`.
